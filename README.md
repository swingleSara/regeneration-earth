# regeneration-earth
Regeneration Earth is a Colorado based non-profit that assists in medically assisted suicide for terminal patients.
The repository here is not their homepage but rather is the database and shallow UI related to storing clients' estate planning documents, accessible to their loved ones
with a chosen secret word and a JavaScript generated code that is provided by the non-profit to the client.  With the secret word and the code, the client's
loved ones can access a password protected* Google Drive folder that contains whichever documents the client chose to provide to the non-profit.

*Google does not currently offer direct password protection, but the use of Google Forms provides a secure workaround.  Instructions to do so can be found here:
